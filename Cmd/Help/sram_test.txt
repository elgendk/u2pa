u2pa sram test TYPE

tests an SRAM of type TYPE by alternating between writing the patterns 0101... and 1010... to every address of
the DUT; then verifies that the expected pattern can be read from every address; then does the same again but with 
the patterns reversed; that is 1010... first, then 0101...
     
    When inserting the EPROM into the ZIF socket of the Top Programmer one must
    be careful to do it correctly; one should call 'info' if in doubt.
