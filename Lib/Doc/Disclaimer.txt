DISCLAIMER:
===========
I've coded this application (U2Pa) for my own pleasure.
You are welcome to use the compiled application it as you like, as long at you
commit yourself to the terms stated in the GLP (included in the file
License.txt).
However I do NOT take any responsibility for the possible destruction of your
EPROM-programmer, ICs, peripherals, etc. as a consequence of using the
application.

If you have any ideas, comments, praisings, beers, etc. you want to give me,
you are welcome to contact me through my blog: 
   http://elgensrepairs.blogspot.com/
However I do NOT promise to implement anything else.

The source code is hosted as a Google Code Project in a Mercurial (hg) repo at
the address:
   https://bitbucket.org/Elgen/u2pa/

Hope you enjoy U2Pa.

Kind Regards
};-P Elgen
