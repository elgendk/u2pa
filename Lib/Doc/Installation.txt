Setting up your system for using U2Pa:
======================================

Windows (native .NET):
----------------------
1)  Make sure that .NET5.0 SDK is installed on your system

2)  Get hold of an Top2005+ Universal Programmer

3)  Download (if it's not on the disc that came with the Top2005+)
    and install TopWin6
    You can get it here (or by using google): http://www.topwin6.com/

4)  Test the programmer and software and make sure it works

5)  Download and install LibUsbDotNet 2.2.8.
    You can get it here (or by using google): 
    http://libusbdotnet.sourceforge.net/V2/Index.html
   
6)  Connect the Top2005+ to the USB-port you wish to use

7)  Launch the Filter Wizard from the LibUsbDotNet->libUsb-win32 start menu

8)  Install a filter for the Top2005+ (it will properly have a description
    saying "TopUSB1" or something like that). By using a filter instead of
    a "real" driver you don't have to uninstall the Top-driver from
    TopWin6 to use U2Pa. You can now use the 2 programs side-by-side

9)  Build the U2Pa-solution with the command
   ~> dotnet build

10) You can now find the command line tool u2pa.exe in the bin-directory

11) The command line tool is best launched from WindowsPowerShell

12) To test that the filter is up and running, you can issue the command
   ~> ./u2pa.exe prog id
   
13) Open the file Config.xml in the subfolder Xml and check that path to
    the file ictest.bin is correct. We need the one from the blib2
    subfolder in the TopWin6 folder

14) You're ready to go };-P


Linux (Mono):
-------------

1)  Download and install the latest version of Mono on your Linux system
    (must support .NET 5.0)
    
2)  Download and install the libusb-1.0 on your Linux system

3)  Build the U2Pa-soluiton with dotnet
    
4)  Connect the Top2005+ to a USB-port

5)  Get hold of the ictest.bin from the blib2-dir of the TopWin6 installation,
    place in a folder, and correct the path in Config.xml accordingly.
    
6)  To test that libusb is up and running, you can issue the command
    ~>./u2pa.exe prog id
    (remember that you have to have access right to the USB-ports. I just
    sudo the u2pa-commands, but then again, I'm no Linux-guru };-P)
    
7)  You're ready to go };-P

    The build-in help can be seen by issuing:
