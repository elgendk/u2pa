Setting up your system for using U2Pa:
======================================
1)  Make sure that .NET4.0 is installed on your system.

2)  Get hold of an Top2005+ Universal Programmer.

3)  Download (if it's not on the disc that came with the Top2005+)
    and install TopWin6.
    You can get it here (or by using google): http://www.topwin6.com/

4)  Test the programmer and software and make sure it works.

5)  Download and install LibUsbDotNet 2.2.8.
    You can get it here (or by using google): 
    http://libusbdotnet.sourceforge.net/V2/Index.html
   
6)  Connect the Top2005+ to the USB-port you wish to use.

7)  Launch the Filter Wizard from the LibUsbDotNet->libUsb-win32 start menu.

8)  Install a filter for the Top2005+ (it will properly have a description
    saying "TopUSB1" or something like that). By using a filter instead of
    a "real" driver you don't have to uninstall the Top-driver from
    TopWin6 to use U2Pa. You can now use the 2 programs side-by-side.

9)  Build the U2Pa-soluiton with VisualStudio (or with the build.bat if
    you haven't got VisualStudio installed).

10) You can now find the command line tool u2pa.exe in the bin-directory.

11) The command line tool is best launched from WindowsPowerShell.

12) To test that the filter is up and running, you can issue the command.
   ~>./u2pa.exe prog id
   
13) Open the file Config.xml in the subfolder Xml and check that path to
    the file ictest.bin is correct. We need the one from the blib2
    subfolder in the TopWin6 folder.

14) You're ready to go };-P
