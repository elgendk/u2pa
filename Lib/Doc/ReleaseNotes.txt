This is the first release of U2Pa, a command line interface for
Top Universal Programmers.

Features:
- Simple reading of some EPROMs 
- Simple (Classic Algorithm) programming of some EPROMs
- Simple test of some SRAMs
- Support for other EPROMs and SRAMs are fairly easy implemented (through XML)
- Coded in C#
- Uses the GPL library LibUsbDotNet (that in turn uses the GPL library
  libusb-1.0)
- The source code is well documented and should by fairly easy to understand
- Runs on both native .NET (tested on Windows7) and Mono (tested on Ubuntu)

Suported and tested programmers:
- Top2005+ Universal Programmer

Supported devices:
- EPROMs: 2716, 2732, 2764, 27128, 27256, 27512 (out of the box)
- EPROMs: 271024, 272048, 274096 (by the use an easy-to-build-adaptor)
- SRAMs:  6116, 6264 (out of the box)
- SRAMs:  6148 (by using 1 wire)

I have observed that the appilication runs twice as fast on Linux as it does
on Windows. I think this is due to the fact, that the implementation of
libusb-1.0 is faster on Linux than on Windows. As a consequence, I recommend
running U2Pa on a Linux box.
