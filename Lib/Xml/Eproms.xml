    <Notes>
      On a Top2005+, pins 11 and 30 can't be GND'ed.
      Therefore GND is applied to pin 20 and /OE is remapped to pin 30.
      You then have to manually remap pins 20, 11, and 30 acordingly
      in order to get a proper GND feed and /OE for the IC.
      This is best done using a simple adapter.
